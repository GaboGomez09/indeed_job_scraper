https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appsharedroid&jk=0d1212be60c29847,Machine Learning Engineer,,Silverfin,,,,"<div id=""jobDescriptionText"" class=""jobsearch-jobDescriptionText""><div><p>This is probably not the first machine learning job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply (link at the bottom) or drop us a line with questions on engineering-recruitment@silverfin.com.<br>
<br>
Ahum. Here it comes.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What’s a Silverfin?</b></h2>
<p>
At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.<br>
<br>
The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?</b></h2>
<p>
We’re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring in this regard, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.<br>
<br>
Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.<br>
<br>
Being remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!<br>
<br>
We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too, as long as there’s no pandemic going around. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.<br>
<br>
Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 7TB, and our largest table recently crossed the 10 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What does working at Silverfin look like?</b></h2>
<p>
You’ll take the lead in setting up the product, infrastructure and organisation to do smart things with all the data we have. Make the lives of our users easier. You’ll answer and implement questions like: Can a computer do a senior review based on historical comments? Can we generate suggestions for a tax calculation? Can bankruptcy be predicted before an accountant notices it? You might even come up with a few answerable questions yourself based on analysis of the data at hand. You will take charge of all the processes from data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, to training models and deploying them to production.<br>
<br>
We work in nimble teams of around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. As our first machine learning engineer, you’ll initially be a team of one, and while we expect you to be able to code most of the core parts yourself, you can rely on support from the other engineering and ops teams to integrate and deploy projects to production.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What does your future look like?</b></h2>
<p>
Initially you’ll work by yourself, but once things move in the right direction, we’re looking to quickly expand the team with you as the teamlead. You will be called on to help out with recruiting, managing and mentoring the other team members once that time comes.<br>
<br>
Everyone has a €1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation and travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day<i>.</i> Silverfin colleagues regularly visit conferences across the world.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What are we looking for?</b></h2>
<ul><li>You’re experienced in applying machine learning, from proof of concept to a production system. You’re able to both get your hands dirty building models, and integrating what you’ve built into a production system. While our core application is built in Ruby on Rails, it’s probably not well-suited for machine learning projects, and you can suggest a more applicable language based on the project. We’re guessing Python.</li>
<li>You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.</li>
<li>You’re able to take initiative and push projects forward without being micromanaged.</li>
<li>You can code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.</li>
<li>You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally.</li>
<li>You recognize and can apply engineering best practices when relevant. This includes the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but you also appreciate hygienic code, good naming, explicitness and readability over cleverness, etc. You’re willing to be flexible and pick-up other practices that the team decides on but you might not agree with.</li>
<li>You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>What can we offer you?</b></h2>
<ul><li>The opportunity to build unique projects based on a significant amount of data, on top of a solid product-oriented foundation</li>
<li>Actual, proper work-life balance</li>
<li>Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely</li>
<li>Personal growth training and opportunities</li>
<li>The possibility to grow the team and become a teamlead</li>
<li>Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries</li>
<li>A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues</li>
<li>A €1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Requirements</b></h2>
<ul><li>You have successfully taken a significant machine learning project from concept to production</li>
<li>At least 2 years of full-time experience with machine learning projects</li>
<li>Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Nice to have’s</b></h2>
<p>
These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team</li>
<li>Experience in Fintech</li>
<li>Accounting knowledge</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Interested?</b></h2>
<ul><li>Read about how our regular development interviewing process looks like (the machine learning engineer job is a bit different, but this should give you some idea)</li>
<li>Or email us with any questions on engineering-recruitment@silverfin.com</li></ul></div></div>",2

<br>#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
<br>We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

<p>
Loon is on a mission to connect people everywhere by inventing and integrating audacious technology. Loon is built on a sophisticated system of products and services that combine advancements in materials science, atmospheric modeling, machine learning, and communications systems. These platforms enable Loon to harness the stratosphere, transforming global connectivity and creating endless possibilities for new applications by bridging ground, sky and space.</p>
<p><b>
Overview</b></p>
<p>
Loon's network orchestration stack is a Temporospatial Software-Defined Network (TS-SDN) for networks that span land, sea, air, and space. It was designed from the ground-up to support multiple aerospace networking projects, which until relatively recently included non-geostationary satellite constellations, in addition to the balloon-based production network that it orchestrates today at Loon.</p>
<p>
Large enterprises and startups are racing to build their own non-geostationary constellations of satellites and high-altitude platforms to provide affordable, broadband Internet service to the billions of people that still lack access to it. But no single solution can solve the problem; just as population densities on Earth are non-uniform and span roughly five orders of magnitude, the tradeoff between coverage and capacity-density will require five altitude layers (towers, stratospheric platforms, low-earth orbiting, mid-earth-orbiting, and geostationary orbiting satellites).</p>
<p>
Enabling the stratospheric layer and the ability for high-altitude platforms to internetwork with the layers above and below is of key strategic interest to Loon. As such, Loon is externalizing its network orchestration stack and transforming it into a multi-tenant production service to enable the internetworking and coordination of the world's aerospace networks.</p>
<p>
Loon is seeking an experienced <b>Software Engineer</b> with graph theory, operations research, and machine learning experience to lead development of our next-generation network optimization engine for satellites and high-altitude platforms. This engine will determine the schedule of beam handovers, radio frequency channel assignments, and network paths that should be used, over time, by a heterogeneous network of ground stations, satellites, balloons, solar gliders, maritime vessels, commercial airlines, and end user devices on Earth. It must also minimize network disruption and packet loss as the network continuously evolves - and rapidly repair the network in the face of any unpredicted link failures.</p>
<p><b>
Responsibilities</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate and down-select from a number of possible strategies for the next-generation solver.</li>
<li>Align stakeholders and build confidence in your proposed strategy.</li>
<li>Lead a small team of 2-3 software engineers (inclusive) to train and turn-up a production serving model within ~18-24 months.</li>

Why Cisco
<br><br>
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
<br><br>
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
<br><br>
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br><br>
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

PDTers are creative, energetic, friendly, entrepreneurial, and collaborative. If you could walk around our office, you'd see that we're a focused, intent, and nimble company with none of the attitude and bureaucracy of a stereotypical Wall Street trading firm.</p>
<p>
Our engineers love to work on challenging and complicated problems, and in return, they have a chance to make a direct impact on our bottom line. For the right talent, there is fantastic growth potential. As an engineer within this group, there are two different opportunities, one working on the trading infrastructure itself, and another putting into production the models that run on this infrastructure.</p>
<p>
Within the Trading Technology group, there are two teams which are described below:</p>
<p><b>
Trading Infrastructure Engineer (TI):</b></p>
<p>
As TI engineer, you'll work on a small, but global team of highly experienced systems and applications engineers focused on the creation, management and support of real-time trading systems. A role on this team offers significant exposure to sophisticated methods of trading, from the handling and distribution of market data to order management and routing solutions.</p>
<p>
Successful candidates come from very strong technical and academic backgrounds, are interested in solving complex technical issues, wish to be deeply involved in hands-on programming. They also enjoy ownership of business-critical projects, working on the full life cycle of large complex systems, from designing and implementing new components and features to supporting and enhancing existing functionality.</p>
<p>
Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop and maintain our proprietary software stack using C++, Assembly, Python, Unix/Linux</li>
<li>Use software development methodologies to implement and extend order management, compliance, exchange connectivity, market data, and routing functionality</li>
<li>Design and implement our next generation real-time trading platform</li>
<li>Maintain and enhance our internal development infrastructure, which includes our build and deployment environments, compilers, debuggers, and other development tools</li>
<li>Manage and support the operation of our global trading system, troubleshooting and debugging issues</li>
<li>Monitor compliance-related issues and market/exchange technology changes</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Strategy Implementation Engineer:</b></p>
<p>
Seeking CS hackers to sift through the raw ore of global markets for suitable input to machine learning pipelines. Must understand how to automate systems that trade 23 hours a day, 6 days a week, and have the courage to make rational decisions when they don't meet expectations. Ideal candidate would find arcane details of software, markets, and statistics fascinating, and be comfortable working in an environment where ingenuity, teamwork, and pragmatism triumph over org chart and politics.</p>
<p>
Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joining a close knit engineering team to design, implement, and manage the full lifecycle of real time quantitative trading systems</li>
<li>Daily work involves coding in Python/C++, maintaining sophisticated machine learning pipelines, and obsessive tracking of model and market performance</li>
<li>Communication: substance valued over style. Expected to contribute to discussions ranging from multivariate distribution modeling to CPU architectures to bar napkin VAR measurements with experts in each of these fields, all in the same day</li>
<li>Must have tenacity to swiftly isolate subtle numeric errors and performance bottlenecks in nuanced and compulsively evolving codebases</li>
<li>Qualifications: Interest in financial markets, expertise in Python, C++, or equivalent languages, undergraduate level understanding of linear algebra and statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>Why join us? PDT Partners has a stellar twenty-six-year track record and a reputation for excellence. Our goal is to be the best quantitative investment manager in the world—measured by the quality of our products, not their size. PDT's very high employee-retention rate speaks for itself. Our people are intellectually extraordinary and our community is close-knit, down-to-earth, and diverse.</p>
<p><b>
Additional Qualifications
</b></p><ul><li>Significant experience programming in one or more of C++, Python, and Java</li>
<li>Ability to collaborate with a larger team on design innovations</li>
<li>Keen debugging, problem-solving, and optimization skills</li>
<li>Pragmatic and mature approach to technology</li>
<li>Experience designing fully automated, scalable, supportable, and reliable trading systems highly desirable</li>
<li>Knowledge of finance and trading systems strongly preferred</li>

We make the world's markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. To get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform.
</p><p>Algo Software Engineers (AE) are programmers that are embedded in HRT's trading teams and work hand-in-hand with Algo Strategy Developers (AD). Whereas ADs tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, AEs focus on the software that powers trading and research. Because of this close collaboration, AEs tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. Hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. AEs are the type of engineers that don't mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.</p>
<p>
Our environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. For one, the company's Partners are all programmers. Team Leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. Algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. Finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training.
</p><p>We are a Linux/Unix shop with a codebase written primarily in C++ and Python. If you are not a C++ or Python or Linux expert, that's probably OK. We really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. That being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as C++ or Java.
</p><p>Here are a few examples of programmers who are currently AEs at HRT:</p>
<ul>
<li>When he's not solving riddles and dancing salsa, David's writing distributed computing APIs. He regularly solves bugs like ""one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on Tuesdays"". He likes bridging the gap between Algo Strategy Developers and Systems Engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. He really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.</li>
<li>Kai came to HRT after 3.5 years of programming C++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. He plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. He builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. He is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.</li>
<li>Aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to HRT. He cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. He gets joy from his teammates' happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable.

One of the things that makes Python great is the fact that it has great libraries. Developers can import numpy and pandas and start building powerful applications. But in the distributed setting today, we don’t have libraries. Instead, we have distributed systems like Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. For example, an online learning system that ingests streaming data, incrementally trains new recommendation models, and then serves recommendations to users will have to stitch together three different distributed systems (one for streaming, one for training, and one for serving) just to build a single application. In the future, people will build these kinds of applications by importing powerful distributed libraries from a rich ecosystem and by composing them together to build new applications. Help us build that ecosystem. This will include libraries for reinforcement learning, hyperparameter tuning, experiment management, model serving, distributed training, and more. Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray.</div><div></div><br>

About Anyscale:</b></div><div>
Anyscale provides an application development platform for developers to build distributed applications. We’re commercializing a popular open source project called Ray, which is a framework for distributed computing as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning. Our goal is to build a standardized platform for distributed computing. Ray was developed at UC Berkeley by Robert Nishihara and Philipp Moritz, under the guidance of Ion Stoica and Michael Jordan, and the four of them have co-founded Anyscale. The company raised a $20.6M Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) with participation from NEA, Intel Capital, Ant Financial, Amplify Partners, 11.2 Capital, and The House Fund.</div><div></div><br>
<div>
With Ray, we're making it easy to program at any scale (from your laptop to the datacenter) by providing easy-to-use, general-purpose, and high-performance tools. In addition, we are building a rich ecosystem of libraries (for reinforcement learning, hyperparameter search, experiment management, machine learning training, prediction serving, and more) on top of the core distributed system so that users can rapidly build sophisticated applications. Help us build the future of software development.</div><div></div><br>

<p><b>
What you get to do in this role:</b></p><p></p><br>
<p>
You will play a major part in building a pioneering conversational interface for interacting with data. Traditional analytical tools tend to require a technically savvy user and a lot of training and experience in order to produce even fairly simple results. We are taking a completely fresh approach with the expectation that any user, regardless of technical knowledge, should be able to pose simple questions using natural language and get meaningful results and visualizations. Any business user familiar with the usual vocabulary they use to talk with their coworkers will be able to get real data from the system. We are just getting started with our early adopter customers and we need your help to scale the architecture to handle our 5k+ enterprise customers around the world.</p><p></p><br>

<p>
Good knowledge of and strong interest in linguistics and NLP. The key job responsibility at first will be to maintain, enhance, and evolve the architecture for the grammar rules which drive our NLQ technology. We need to evolve from customer/user interviews to test the effectiveness of our query grammar to a more automatic, context dependent, adaptive, learned-from-data style of grammar management. This will bring you into direct contact with the most sophisticated contemporary neural network-based NLP technologies (think Transformers, BERT, ALBERT, etc.) as we grow, while keeping you grounded in a tech stack that will remain relevant as various waves of AI hype come and go.</p><p></p><br>
<p>
You will be joining a strong team with domain experts ready to teach you anything you don’t already know. An exact match on skills is less critical than strong design instincts, high quality coding discipline and enthusiasm for taking on an ambitious project that will reshape the way people interact with enterprise software. Be there from the beginning!</p><p></p><br>

<br>We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

<p>
Founded in 2012, OppLoans is one of the highest-rated online lenders and service providers in the industry, offering or facilitating emergency bridge financing to non-prime borrowers in a rapidly growing number of states. With fast funding, significantly lower rates, total transparency, and unmatched customer service, OppLoans provides consumers nationwide with a reliable, socially responsible alternative to payday lending. Half of all Americans have subprime credit scores and can't qualify for a traditional bank loan, while 57% have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts. When a sudden car repair or medical or family expense happens, these consumers are forced to choose between predatory payday loans, additional credit card debt, or bank overdraft fees. OppLoans fights back against ""predatory"" players by offering an unheard-of level of transparency, support, and social responsibility in our emergency credit products. To keep that fight going, we need sharp, skillful, and hard-working individuals like yourself to help us remove barriers between underbanked Americans and the emergency credit they need. Reach out to us at Info@OppLoans.com or visit our careers page to learn more. We are headquartered in downtown Chicago's historic Prudential Building overlooking Millennium Park. Recent accolades for OppLoans include: - Ranked on the Inc. 500 List for three consecutive years. - Named 6th Best Place to Work Nationally by Glassdoor. - Named one of the Country's Best Workplaces by Inc.

<p>
At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.</p>
<p>
We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.</p>
<p>
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.</p>

</i></p><p><b>About Freenome</b></p>
<p>
Freenome is on a mission to empower everyone with the tools they need to detect, treat, and ultimately prevent cancer.</p>
<p>
We have pioneered the most comprehensive multiomics platform for early cancer detection through a routine blood draw. By combining deep expertise in molecular biology with advanced computational biology and machine learning techniques to recognize disease-associated patterns among billions of circulating, cell-free biomarkers, we are developing simple and accurate blood tests for early cancer detection and integrating the actionable insights into health systems to operationalize a machine learning feedback loop between care and science.</p>
<p>
Our recent $270 Million Series C brings our financing to over $500 million from investors, including; Bain Capital, Perceptive Advisors, RA Capital, Polaris Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., GV (formerly Google Ventures), Roche Venture Fund, Kaiser Permanente Ventures, American Cancer Society’s BrightEdge Ventures, Data Collective Venture Capital, Novartis and Verily Life Sciences.</p>
<p>
Our Science</p>
<p>
Freenome is building technology to advance the understanding of cancer through multiple analytes derived from blood. These signals include cell-free DNA, methylation of cell-free DNA, cell-free RNA, circulating proteins, and immune profiling derived from thousands of prospective samples. By developing novel statistical learning methods and applying them to integrate various -omics datasets, Freenome is a leader in modeling specific biological mechanisms to capture disease-dependent signatures, including gene expression, immune response, tumor burden, the tissue of origin, and 3D chromatin structure.</p>
<p>
By building comprehensive discovery datasets and modeling critical biological systems, Freenome is learning what biological changes are present within the blood between a variety of different disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infections, drug response, and aging. The synthesis of Freenome’s datasets, cross-functional technical expertise, and audacious mission to discover biological truth, we seek to improve the lives of millions through early detection and early treatment of disease.</p>
<p>
Our Culture</p>
<p>
Freenomers are technical, creative, visionary, grounded, empathetic, and passionate. We build teams around divergent expertise, allowing us to solve problems and ascertain opportunities in unique ways. Freenomers are some of the most talented experts in their fields, joining together to advance healthcare, one breakthrough at a time.</p>
<p>
We value empathy, integrity, and trust in one another, and we respect the diverse perspectives of our colleagues and those we serve. We assume positive intent and give each other the benefit of the doubt with the firm belief that we are a team working toward the same objectives. We believe in empowering and supporting each other in a collaborative and dynamic environment.</p>
<p>
What does a successful person look like at Freenome?</p>
<p>
Those who thrive at Freenome prioritize, manage, and execute their own goals with ownership and alignment with those of the company. They embrace our values of empathy, integrity, striving for greatness, servant leadership, trust, and holding themselves and their team accountable to these values. They crave collaboration with brilliant minds from disparate fields of study and believe that hiring and mentorship are fundamental to our success.

<br>
<br>
As other sectors have shifted to eCommerce-first business models in recent years, food &amp; beverage has continued to rely predominantly on traditional brick &amp; mortar models, but this is changing rapidly. New technologies are transforming every aspect of reaching consumers, from the rise of digital marketing and online grocery platforms to the creation of supply chain tools that enable speedy at-home delivery.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appsharedroid&jk=2c1b2b293fea5a7b,Full-Stack Engineer,,Render,,,,"<div id=""jobDescriptionText"" class=""jobsearch-jobDescriptionText""><div><div><div>When deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.</div><div></div><br>
<div>
Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.</div><div></div><br>
<div>
We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for engineers with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.</div><div></div><br>
<div>
Our platform serves over a billion requests every month, and we have tens of thousands of users including Stripe, NYU, and US presidential campaigns. We have product-market fit and rapidly increasing revenue, and we're backed by the same early stage investors behind Airbnb, Snap, and Stripe.</div><div></div><br>
<div>
As a full-stack engineer at Render, you will take complete, end-to-end ownership of projects across the entire stack. You should already have experience building products across the stack and have a keen understanding of web frameworks, APIs, databases and multiple backend languages.</div><div></div><br>
<div><b>
Engineering at Render</b></div><div></div><br>
<div>
We're a small team of world-class full-stack engineers. We have complete, end-to-end ownership for every project we take on and expect the same from you. We review all major code changes through pull requests and are always pushing ourselves to do better. We iterate quickly and deploy to production several times a day.</div><div></div><br>
<div><b>
Technical challenges</b></div><div></div><br>
<div>
The biggest issues with platforms like Heroku are lack of flexibility, and cost. We are solving the cost problem by using containers and Kubernetes and intelligently scaling compute resources up and down. This will continue to be a major area of engineering investment for us going forward.</div><div></div><br>
<div>
We solve lack of flexibility by using Kubernetes under the hood and abstracting all the associated complexity so our users get all the benefits (load balancing, service discovery, autoscaling, health checks, self-healing) without needing to manage Kubernetes or build everything on AWS.</div><div></div><br>
<div>
The challenge is in building the right user-facing abstractions that make simple application deployments effortless and complex application deployments possible. User experience is our primary focus and drives everything we do.</div></div>
<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Why join us</b></h3><div><ul><li>
We're solving a problem faced by every developer and development team. It's a massive and rapidly growing market (AWS is privately valued at over $200B, and there are over 20 million professional developers globally).</li><li>
We serve over 1 billion requests every month, our users love us, and our revenue is growing quickly.</li><li>
Our stock grants are in the 99th percentile.</li><li>
Everyone wants to move their infrastructure to Kubernetes, but it's too complex for the average development team. Render makes it possible to get the power of Kubernetes without any of its complexity.</li><li>
The former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox are two of our biggest investors and cheerleaders.</li><li>
The company is led by Anurag Goel, who was employee #8 and Head of Risk at Stripe. He helped Stripe scale from 10 to over 400 people and is applying many of the same principles that helped Stripe succeed to Render.</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Projects you might work on</b></h3><div><ul><li>
You will create open source projects and documentation in multiple languages and frameworks to demo Render's features.</li><li>
We run our Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud Platform and AWS. You will enable Render's clusters to run on other clouds and eventually in our own data-centers. You will also allow our users to connect Render resources with their private networks in existing public cloud infrastructure.</li><li>
You will create an effortless serverless abstraction on Render and enable per-request billing for containerized resources.</li><li>
You will build a managed MySQL product for Render users.</li><li>
You will use machine learning to optimize container scheduling and save resources while keeping user workloads responsive.</li><li>
Render works great with GitHub and GitLab repos. You will add Bitbucket integration.</li><li>
You will build out Render's CLI and make the user dashboard even better.</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Some benefits we offer</b></h3><div><ul><li>
Comprehensive medical, dental and vision coverage with PPO plans and 100% of your premiums paid by Render.</li><li>
99th percentile stock grants and a comfortable San Francisco salary.</li><li>
Four weeks paid vacation, and vacation days are only counted when you take more than one at a time.
</li><li>Work from home if you have a delivery or chore to take care of.</li><li>
3 months paid maternity and paternity leave.</li><li>
Commuter benefits including Lyft and SF Muni passes.</li><li>
A sunny, beautiful, well-stocked office in SoMa close to Caltrain and BART.</li><li>
Monthly gym membership allowance.</li><li>
Build your own laptop/workstation with any peripheral or accessory you need.</li><li>
Use the company card to order any work-related ebook or p-book, and buy anything to make your work environment more ergonomic.</li><li>
Financial and logistical assistance to help you relocate to the Bay Area.</li><li>
Immigration assistance.</li><li>
Birthday celebrations, weekly happy hours, company dinners, and semi-annual team retreats.</li><li>
Surprise gifts for the holidays!</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>You are a great fit for this role if</b></h3><div><ul><li>
You have a few years of professional experience building software. Bonus points if you’ve excelled at a small, high-growth startup.</li><li>
You have an intuitive understanding of web frameworks, APIs, and databases, and have worked with multiple programming languages.</li><li>
You are both curious by nature and an impressively quick learner.</li><li>
You are unfazed by unfamiliar codebases and enjoy figuring things out on your own.</li><li>
You can wear multiple hats and work across the stack, both collaboratively and independently.</li><div></div><br>
<div>
The ideal candidate would check everything above, but you should certainly apply if you identify with most of it.</div></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><b>Working at Render</b></div><div></div><br>
<div>
We value high integrity, low ego, an affinity for continuous learning, and the ability to figure things out quickly.
